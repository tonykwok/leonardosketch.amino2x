This is the root repo for Amino2. Please ignore the older Amino2 repo.
This one is called amino2x.

Amino is a crossplatform 2.5D scenegraph. It has ports for Java w/ Java2D,
and JavaScript using HTML 5 Canvas. Other ports may be added in the future. The
APIs are as identical as possible while taking advantage of inherent language
strengths. Amino is designed to be simple to use, simple to maintain, and simple
to improve performance over time.

You can build amino by going into tools/ and running 'ant all'
